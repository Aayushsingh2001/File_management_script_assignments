DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy that automate and integrate the processes between software development and IT teams.
It emphasizes team empowerment, cross-team communication and collaboration, and technology automation.
DevOps combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops) to increase the efficiency, speed, and security of software development and delivery compared to traditional processes.
A more nimble software development lifecycle results in a competitive advantage for businesses and their customers.
DevOps is all about the unification and automation of processes, and DevOps engineers are instrumental in combining code, application maintenance, and application management.
All of these tasks rely on understanding not only development life cycles, but DevOps culture, and its philosophy, practices, and tools.
